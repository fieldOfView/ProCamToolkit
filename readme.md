# mapamok

This is a complex app that will allow you to load a COLLADA file called `model.dae`, and then specify some number of points between the model and the corresponding location in the projection. After enough points have been selected, it will solve for the projector location and set the OpenGL viewport to render with the same intrinsics as the projector.
